## Overview

This project consists of 2 separate parts:

1. A Django project containing the backend, accessible via a REST API (conduit-django/)
2. A React project containing the frontend (conduit-react/)

## Requirements

The Django portion of the project runs on Python 3.5.1, and Django 1.9.6. The other requirements can be found in conduit-django/requirements.txt

The React portion of the app was created using the npm package create-react-app, and should run with any recent version of npm

## Running the Apps

To run the Django app, just cd to conduit-django and run 'python manage.py runserver'. This should start a test server listening to http://localhost:8000.

To run the React app, cd to conduit-react and run npm start
